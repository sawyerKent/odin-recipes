        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            This classic beef tips recipe by Chef John is a comforting and budget-friendly
            way to transform tough cuts of beef into a delicious meal. It starts with 1.5
            pounds of beef round steak seasoned with kosher salt and freshly ground black
            pepper. The meat is seared in a hot pan with vegetable oil, creating a flavorful
            crust. Then, garlic and tomato paste are added for a savory kick, followed by a
            luscious sauce made by combining butter and all-purpose flour. Low-sodium beef
            broth is poured in, and the mixture is simmered until the beef becomes
            melt-in-your-mouth tender. This hearty dish is traditionally served over crispy
            frozen potato nuggets, like Tater Tots®, for a satisfying and nostalgic meal.
            Alternatively, you can customize it with toppings like diced red onion, grated
            Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions or serve it over mashed potatoes
            for a comforting twist.

        <h3>ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with
                salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer.
                Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and
                then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is
                starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat
                is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While meat simmers, bake potato nuggets in the preheated oven until crispy and heated through, 20 to 25
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste beef tips and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately over hot potato nuggets.</li>
        </ol>
